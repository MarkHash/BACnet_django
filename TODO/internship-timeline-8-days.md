## üéØ Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

If time is tight, focus on **MUST HAVE** features:

### **MUST HAVE (Core MVP):**
1. ‚úÖ Create single virtual BACnet device via web UI
2. ‚úÖ Device is discoverable on network
3. ‚úÖ Device stored in database
4. ‚úÖ Basic list view of virtual devices
5. ‚úÖ Delete virtual device
6. ‚úÖ Management command to start virtual device server

### **NICE TO HAVE (If time permits):**
- Multiple virtual devices (port management)
- Custom virtual points (analogInput, etc.)
- Update device properties
- Device status monitoring
- Advanced error handling

### **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Document only):**
- Write property support
- COV (Change of Value) subscriptions
- Trend logging integration
- Device groups/categories
- Advanced point types

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### **High Risk Items:**
1. **BAC0 virtual points complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with device-only (no custom points)
   - Fallback: Document as future enhancement

2. **Process lifecycle (keeping BAC0 running)**
   - Mitigation: Use simple management command for MVP
   - Fallback: Manual start/stop for demo

3. **Port conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Start with single device only
   - Fallback: Use non-standard port with documentation

4. **Network discovery issues**
   - Mitigation: Test early (Day 2 POC)
   - Fallback: Have alternative demo approach

### **Time Buffers:**
- Day 7: Buffer day for catching up if behind
- Day 8: Can start earlier if needed
