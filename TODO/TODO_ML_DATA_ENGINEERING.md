## 🔄 Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decision: Why No Kafka?
- Current data volume: ~718 readings/day (< 1/minute average)
- Existing Celery + Redis handles real-time processing efficiently
- PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance for building automation
- Lower infrastructure costs while maintaining scalability
- **Portfolio talking point**: Right-sized architecture showing engineering judgment

### Data Quality Considerations
- Device 36578: Primary data source (1,771/1,777 readings = 99.7% success rate)
- Device 2000: Secondary source (308/313 readings = 98.4% success rate)
- Focus ML training on these high-quality data sources

### Future Scalability
- Current architecture supports 10x data growth
- Horizontal scaling via additional Celery workers
- Database partitioning strategy for time-series data
- Caching layer optimization for frequently accessed analytics

---

**Priority**: Focus on **Anomaly Detection** first - it has the highest portfolio impact and uses your best data (analog sensors with continuous values).

**Timeline**: Aim to complete Anomaly Detection by end of Week 2, allowing flexibility for testing and refinement in remaining weeks.
