if abs(skewness) > 1.0:
    base_threshold += 0.3  # Skewed distribution
if sensor_age > 5_years:
    base_threshold += 0.2  # Older sensors less reliable

# Environmental adjustments
if season == 'summer' and system_type == 'cooling':
    base_threshold -= 0.2  # More sensitive during peak season

final_threshold = min(base_threshold, 4.0)  # Cap maximum
```
