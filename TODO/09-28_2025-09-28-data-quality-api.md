# Data Quality Monitoring API Implementation
**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Branch:** feat/data-quality-monitoring
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Data Quality Monitoring API that analyzes BACnet device data across four key quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, freshness, and consistency.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Project Setup
- Created new git branch `feat/data-quality-monitoring`
- Updated requirements.txt with `numpy==1.26.4` (fixed Docker build issues)
- Resolved import issues (`import np` → `import numpy as np`)

### 2. ✅ Data Quality Serializers
**File:** `discovery/serializers.py`
- `DataQualityMetricsSerializer` - Core quality scores
- `PointQualitySerializer` - Individual point analysis
- `DeviceDataQualitySerializer` - Device-level aggregation
- `DataQualityResponseSerializer` - Complete API response structure

### 3. ✅ Data Quality API Implementation
**File:** `discovery/views.py`
- Created modular helper functions:
  - `calculate_completeness_score()` - Missing readings analysis
  - `calculate_accuracy_score()` - Outlier detection using IQR method
  - `calculate_freshness_score()` - Exponential decay based on recency
  - `calculate_consistency_score()` - Reading interval regularity
- Implemented `DataQualityAPIView` class with comprehensive analytics
- Fixed field name issues (`timestamp` → `read_time`)
- Added device-level and system-wide metric aggregation

### 4. ✅ URL Routing
**File:** `discovery/urls.py`
- Added `GET /api/v2/devices/data-quality/` endpoint
- Followed existing v2 API naming conventions

### 5. ✅ Testing & Validation
- Successfully tested API endpoint
- Verified JSON response structure
- Confirmed all quality metrics calculations work correctly
- API returns proper error handling and structured responses

### 6. ✅ Documentation
**File:** `README.md`
- Added API endpoint to Modern DRF API section
- Included example curl commands
- Added complete JSON response example with realistic data
- Explained all quality metrics with clear definitions
- Updated changelog to reflect new feature

## API Endpoint Details

**URL:** `GET /api/v2/devices/data-quality/`

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Completeness Score (0-100%)**: Expected readings vs missing (assumes 5-min intervals)
- **Accuracy Score (0-100%)**: Outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) method
- **Freshness Score (0-100%)**: Exponential decay based on time since last reading
- **Consistency Score (0-100%)**: Regularity of reading intervals (low std dev = high score)
- **Overall Quality Score**: Weighted average (40% completeness, 30% accuracy, 20% freshness, 10% consistency)

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": { /* System-wide averages */ },
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": 123,
      "metrics": { /* Device-level scores */ },
      "point_quality": [ /* Individual point analysis */ ],
      "data_coverage_percentage": 85.1,
      "avg_reading_interval_minutes": 5.2
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-09-28T11:13:45Z"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Analysis Approach
1. **Fixed Interval Assumption**: 5-minute expected reading frequency
2. **24-Hour Analysis Window**: Focus on recent data quality
3. **Statistical Methods**: IQR for outlier detection, standard deviation for consistency
4. **Modular Design**: Separate functions for each quality dimension

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries with proper filtering
- Calculated metrics on-demand (no pre-aggregation)
- Handles empty datasets gracefully
- Proper error handling and validation

### Code Quality
- Followed existing codebase patterns and conventions
- Used Django REST Framework best practices
- Implemented proper serialization and validation
- Added comprehensive error handling

## Issues Resolved
1. **Docker Build Failure**: Updated numpy from 1.24.3 to 1.26.4 for Python 3.12 compatibility
2. **Import Error**: Fixed `import np` to `import numpy as np`
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: Changed `timestamp` to `read_time` throughout codebase
4. **Syntax Errors**: Fixed extra parentheses in summary calculations
5. **Variable Scope Issues**: Properly organized data aggregation logic

## Test Results
- ✅ API responds with `"success": true`
- ✅ Analyzed 6 active devices with comprehensive metrics
- ✅ Identified data staleness (5+ days old readings)
- ✅ Properly calculated quality scores and aggregations
- ✅ All serializers validated correctly

## Files Modified
- `discovery/views.py` - Added DataQualityAPIView and helper functions
- `discovery/serializers.py` - Added 4 new serializer classes
- `discovery/urls.py` - Added data quality endpoint routing
- `requirements.txt` - Updated numpy version
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive API documentation

## Next Steps for Future Development
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Add WebSocket support for live quality updates
2. **Alerting System**: Implement quality threshold alerts
3. **Historical Trending**: Store quality metrics for trend analysis
4. **Custom Thresholds**: Allow configurable quality score parameters
5. **Export Features**: Add CSV/Excel export for quality reports
6. **Dashboard UI**: Create frontend visualization for quality metrics

## Data Engineering Value
This API provides the foundation for:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identify degrading data sources
- **System Reliability**: Monitor BACnet network health
- **Data Governance**: Ensure data quality standards
- **Operational Intelligence**: Make data-driven infrastructure decisions
